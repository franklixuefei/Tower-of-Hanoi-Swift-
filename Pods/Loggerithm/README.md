A lightweight Swift logger, uses `println` in Debug and `NSLog` in Production with colourful output.

## Why

In Swift, we usually use `println` to log information into console. However, it doesn't log anything in production version. 

Thus we want to use `NSLog` in production but still want the efficiency of `println` in development. (`println` is faster than `NSLog`).

This project started more than half a year ago, named [ZHSwiftLogger](https://github.com/honghaoz/ZHSwiftLogger). At that time, no other Swift loggers provide this functionality. So I developped this logger for my personal usage.

Nowadays, we have more and more great Swift loggers. While, **Loggerithm** is lightweight, pretty straightforward and handy to use.

## Features
- [x] Use `println` in Debug and `NSLog` in Production.
- [x] Formatted output, just like `NSLog`.
- [x] Log level Support.
- [x] Colorful output and color customization.
- [x] Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage.

## Installation

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

To integrate **Loggerithm** into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Loggerithm', '~> 1.2'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually
- Add Swift files in **Source** folder into your project

- Add `DEBUG` flag to Swift Compiler:
  - Open project setting
  - Select your target
  - Go to `Build Settings`
  - Search `Swift`
  - Under **Swift Compiler - Custom Flags** section, in **Other Swift Flags** line, add `-D DEBUG`

### Colorful Output Support
Need [XcodeColors](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) plugin installed.

#### XcodeColors Installation
- You can fork [XcodeColors](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) repo and build to install it.
- Or use [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io) to install it

#### Setup Environment Variable
Once XcodeColors is installed and loaded properly. To let logger automatically turn on, you need to add `"XcodeColors" = "YES"` environment variable to your build scheme.

This can be done in following way:
- Under target selection, click **Edit Scheme...**
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honghaoz/Loggerithm/master/Assets/scheme-select.png)
- Under **Arguments** tab, in **Environment Variables**, hit **+** to add a new environment variable with name "XcodeColors" and value "YES".

You can also manually force to turn on/off colorful output by modifying `useColorfulLog` property

## Usage

### Basic 
> If you are using Cocoapods to integrate Loggerithm. Import Loggerithm first:
> ```swift
> import Loggerithm
> ```

```swift
var log = Loggerithm()

// Usage example
log.verbose("Verbose message...")
log.debug("Debug message...")
log.info("Info message...")
log.warning("Warning message...")
log.error("Error message...")
```

### Log Levels

By default, `logLevel` is `.Verbose` for development and `.Warning` for Production.

`LogLevel` from low to high is 
> `.All`
>
> `.Verbose` 
>
> `.Debug` 
>
> `.Info` 
>
> `.Warning` 
>
> `.Error` 
>
> `.Off`

Logging with level lower than `logLevel` will be ignored.

### Advanced

#### Format

Log string containts 5 fields, format is:

> `y-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS [LogLevel] [FileName:LineNumber] functionName: message`

All logging fields can be turned on/off:
```swift
var log = Loggerithm()

log.showDateTime = false
log.info("date time is turned off.")

log.showLineNumber = false
log.info("Line number is turned off.")

log.showFileName = false
log.info("File name is turned off.")

log.showFunctionName = false
log.info("Function name is turned off.")

log.showLogLevel = false
log.info("Log level is turned off.")

log.emptyLine()
log.info("Restoring to full format...")
```

Results:

#### Formatted Output

```swift
var log = Loggerithm()
log.verbose("I can use format: %d + %d = %d", args: 1, 1, 2)
```

Results:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honghaoz/Loggerithm/master/Assets/formatted.png)

### Color Output

#### Switch On/Off
See **Installation**/**Colorful Output Support** for more detail.

You can modify `useColorfulLog` to turn on/off colorful output.
```swift
log.useColorfulLog = false
log.info("Color is turned off.")
log.useColorfulLog = true
log.info("Color is turned on.")
```
Note, If you don't have [XcodeColors](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors) plugin installed but leaving `useColorfulLog` turned on, this will result it hidden color setting code to be visible:

```
[fg190,190,190;2015-08-14 16:55:34.075 [Verbose] [ViewController.swift:34] viewDidLoad(): Verbose message...[;
[fg60,161,202;2015-08-14 16:55:34.076 [Debug] [ViewController.swift:35] viewDidLoad(): Debug message...[;
```

#### Color Customization
```swift
var log = Loggerithm()

log.verboseColor = UIColor.grayColor()
log.debugColor = UIColor.greenColor()
log.infoColor = UIColor.yellowColor()
log.warningColor = UIColor.orangeColor()
log.errorColor = UIColor.redColor()

log.verbose("Verbose message...")
log.debug("Debug message...")
log.info("Info message...")
log.warning("Warning message...")
log.error("Error message...")
```

Results:
